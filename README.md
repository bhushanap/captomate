# Captomate: Automated Captioning Tool

NOTE: This was just a hobby project with no proper organized code structure or documentation. I am sharing it in case it might help others. I don't plan on maintaining this repository.

## Use

Captomate allows you to add captions on videos. It makes tiktok style captioning videos easy.

You can:
- Add captions on top of your own video files / auto-downloaded videos from youtube / demo no copyright game videos (check demo/ folder)
- Add a separate audio on top of the video files / use AI text to speech audio
- Generate captions from the audio / generate captions from uploaded subtitle file
- Change how the captions look as per substation alpha format
