# Captomate: Automated Captioning Tool 🎥

NOTE: This was just a hobby project with no proper organized code structure or documentation. I am sharing it in case it might help others. I don't plan on maintaining this repository. 📝

## Use 🚀

Captomate allows you to add captions on videos. It makes tiktok style captioning videos easy. 💬

You can:
- Add captions on top of your own video files
- Use AI to generate text to speech audio
- Modify captions look as per substation alpha format

## Installation 💻

This has only been tested in Ubuntu 22.04 on amd64 CPU. You can raise an issue if you find some issues and I can try to help.
Open a terminal and in the root directory make install.sh and run.sh executable

    chmod +x run.sh
    chmod +x install.sh

After that just start the install.sh and it should create a virtual environment and auto install everything for you.

I do not have a bat file for installation on windows, so if anyone can make it, that would be awesome :)

    . install.sh

You would also need to install FFMPEG on your device for this software to work.
